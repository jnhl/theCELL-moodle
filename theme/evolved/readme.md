evolve-D
======================

Evolve-D(earborn) encapsulates simplicity, function, and style as it unites many notable Moodle theme features into an evolved "More" theme. Evolve-D applies famed theme elements such as custom frontpage, Google Fonts, My Courses dropdown, block icons, and a variety of other enhancements made popular in Essential and Aardvark Themes.  The evolve-D theme's appeal comes from it's simple 2 column design, muted colors, and focus on displaying content and minimizing distractions.

[Dearborn Public Schools](http://dearbornschools.org) is a K-12 school distict in Dearborn, Michigan. We designed and use evolve-D on our Moodle site.

Special thanks to [Aardvark](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_aardvark) and [Essential](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=theme_essential) theme developers Shaun Daubney and Julian Ridden for thier work which is replicated in part here.
